# CoinForTechConf

Worry less about $$$ and focus on attending an upcoming tech conference!

This bot will retweet info about tech conference scholarships.

## Project Goal:
A bot that automatically searches for mentions of technology conference scholarships at set time intervals. Yielded results are automatically retweeted.

## Target Audience:

Aspiring and current tech students who wouldn't be able to attend tech conferences without financial assistance

## Personal Learning Goals:

  - Scheduling recurring, automated tasks with cron (and perhaps Whenever gem assistance)
  - Getting a bot to post all by itself (you can do it, little bot!)
  - Learning more about the bot community. Release the bots! üëæüëæüëæ

## Technologies / Frameworks / Patterns

  - Rails
  - Possibly chatterbot. I need to research more about this library
  - cron
  - Possibly whenever
  - Twitter API
  - VCR for testing

## Tech Dependencies
  - My bot's life depends on Twitter! We'll need to play well with their TOS.


## Skill Dependences
  - This will be my first foray into bots, #botlyfe, and being a #botALLY. Wish me luck! I'll need to dig through bot community forums, guides, and projects for implementation ideas
  - My little bot's health will depend on TDD

## What Success Looks Like
  - Getting CoinForTechConf to retweet relevant scholarship info by itself
  - Avoid retweeting offensive and irrelevant content

## Added Fun
  - Filtering search results by certain criteria: Number of favorites and retweets, very specific keywords, etc
  - Having CoinForTechConf add its own hashtags to retweets for easier sorting
  - ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è Having CoinForTechConf remember deadlines mentioned and tweet out periodic application reminders
